# Introduction of SpringSide3 and Calvin Xiu #

SpringSide is a Kickstart template system based on Spring Framework, which focuses
on pragmatic approaches for the Enterprise Applications.

It was started by Calvin Xiu, http://code.google.com/u/calvinxiu/, who was inspired
by Appfuse and wanted to developed a more pragmatic framework using some popular
frameworks and technologies in the Java EE's world.

I will work with Calvin to merge SpringSide-sub into SpringSide someday when
I feel comfortable with this project.

Calvin continues his work on SpringSide3, and I might probably continue to integrate his
work into this project to make sure the compatibility.
